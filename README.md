## Notes on Workflow

- Starting 23/11/25, PR descriptions for this repository are generated using ChatGPT and a visual Git graph (`git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph`),
with commit subject lines manually entered in capitalized conventional commit format.
- Git versioning is used to maintain a neat record of work. This is **not** required for the course.
- **Important:** No code in this repository has been generated or edited by ChatGPT â€” only PR documentation is assisted.
